## Description
This workout tracker allows users to input exercises done during a workout, along with duration, weights lifted, distance travelled, and other useful information. It allows the user to keep on top of their fitness, and also reflect on how much progress they've made in the past 7 days. It includes a dashboard which shows the exercises done by the user.

## Usage
The user should navigate to the deployed site on Heroku. If they'd like to use it locally, they can download the necessary files, install dependencies, and run 'node server.js' to run on their local machine.

## Installation
To install dependencies, run the following command: 
```
npm i
```
